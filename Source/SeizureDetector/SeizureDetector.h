// The multi-band integrator allows the user to take a weighted sum of up to 3 frequency bands and apply a rolling average to build
// a power signal for complex waveforms with well-defined spectral properties.  It was initially developed to detect absence-like seizures
// in real time from EEG recorded in awake, head-fixed mice.

// The user sets the duration of the rolling window and input channel, as well as frequency ranges and gains that define the waveform of interest  
// The processed signal is output on the same channel as the input channel. Two adjacent channels are overwritten with the initial raw input 
// channel and the weighted summed signal before averaging to allow the user to fine-tune frequency ranges and gains on a per-animal basis.  
// Because channels are overwritten, I recommend using a split path in open ephys.  One of the split paths includes the seizure detector followed
// by an LFP viewer to show how the input channel is being filtered.  The other contains a second LFP viewer to show all of the channels without
// any multi-band integrator processing

// This plugin can be used with the third party crossing detector plugin to trigger events based on the processed output from the multi-band integrator.
